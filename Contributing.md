### Who can Contribute?

Anyone with a real passion for learning to code in a friendly environment. It would be helpful to know Html, CSS and Javascript as it is highly likely we will be using these. We have not yet decided what different frameworks to use for the backend.

### Don't know git yet? Here is a rundown on git:

`git@github.com:drewlearns/100daysofcode_reminder_app.git`
This command will allow you to clone our repo locally.

`git checkout -b "NAME_OF_YOUR_BRANCH"` Create a new branch from develop branch and do your work.

When you are done coding something for an issue. Run: `git add .` (that period means all files, you can specify a file name if you choose) this will stage all your changes for `git commit -m "YOUR_COMMIT_MESSAGE"`.

After you commit, you'll want to push your changes using `git push` - it's likely that your upstream isn't ready yet and the output of that command will tell you something like `git push --set-upstream origin NAME_OF_YOUR_BRANCH`, run that and then your changes will be visibile on https://github.com/drewlearns/OS_100days.
